# Fan Cones
This was a 3D printed item that would mount on to a modified server fan to act as an electronic air duster.  It was modeled in OnShape.

# Version 1
- The first design did not have any air blowing through it
  - The air would flow through to the back and blow from the back
 
# Version 2
- The second design used a design taken from an another electronic fan blower
  - This also didn't work as the air would still blow from the back

# Version 3 (Final Version)
- The final design used vents to help with airflow
- Air still blowed from the back, but also came from the front
  - The vents seemed to help with airflow
